***************DSA: Data structure and algorithms
Data Structure + Algorithm = Program

"Data Structures are simply used to store data and algorithms are the way to use those data structures to write good programs"

DSA will give you a way to think like a good programmer. A good programmer is one, who choose write data struture and choose right algorithm to wirte a good program which is readable and scalable.

And good developer have this knowledge to choose right data structure and right algorithm. 


******************************************************Big O Asymptotic analysis

A good is what which is readable and scalable, Big O allows us to measure the scalablity of a code.

Let say you and your friend ran a below code in their PCs

const large = new Array(100).fill('nemo');

let t0 = performance.now()
function findNemo(array){
for (i=0; i<array.length; i++){
if(array[i]==='nemo;){ console.log('Found Nemo'); }
}
let t1 = performance.now()
}



console.log(`This function took ${t1-t0} milliseconds`);

findNemo(large);


//This function took 334.540802090239 milliseconds

Both will get different time for their execution.What does it means that?
Do your friend won or you?

The answer is that we cannot decide it in this way. Here comes BigO which tells us about the efficiency of an alogirth. Greater the number of inputs and slower the alogirthm will be. Efficient algorithm do not get slow down rapidly on increasing the number of inputs.

Big O chart:

y-axis: No of operations
x-axis: No of inputs

Big 0 notation tells us, as the number of inputs are going to increase how many number of operations an algorithm or function have to perform.

** O(n)
In our nemo function case as the elements in the arrays (inputs) increases same number of operations performed by the function will be increase. So we can say there is a linear relation between no. of inputs and no. of operations. So its notation will be O(n)

***O(1) notation:
function anyFunction(boxes){
console.log(boxes[0]);
}

here in this case no matter how many inputs/values/entries are there in boxes array we always going to have only one operation.

so we can say its graph will be a constant line. Therefore, we call it O(1) constant time;

O(1) notation is an excellent notation as this function is most efficient and never gonna slow on increasig the number of inputs

**********Exercise
// What is the Big O of the below function? (Hint, you may want to go line by line)
function funChallenge(input) {
  let a = 10; // O(1)
  a = 50 + 3; // O(1)

  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) { // O(n)
    anotherFunction(); // O(n)
    let stranger = true; // O(n)
    a++; // O(n)
  }
  return a; // O(1)
}

O(1) + O(1)+ O(1) + O(n) +O(n) + O(n) + O(n)
Big O notation of for this function is O(3+4n)


// What is the Big O of the below function? (Hint, you may want to go line by line)
function anotherFunChallenge(input) {
    let a = 5; // O(1)
    let b = 10; // O(1)
    let c = 50; // O(1)
    for (let i = 0; i < input; i++) { // O(n)
      let x = i + 1; // O(n)
      let y = i + 2; // O(n)
      let z = i + 3; // O(n)

    }
    for (let j = 0; j < input; j++) { // O(n)
      let p = j * 2; // O(n)
      let q = j * 2; // O(n) 
    }
    let whoAmI = "I don't know"; // O(1)
  }

  // Big O = 4 + 7n = O(n)


***************Rules to find Big O
***********Big O cheat sheet

*****BigOs
O(1) Constant- no loops
O(log N) Logarithmic- usually searching algorithms have log n if they are sorted (Binary Search)
O(n) Linear- for loops, while loops through n items
O(n log(n)) Log Liniear- usually sorting operations
O(n^2) Quadratic- every element in a collection needs to be compared to ever other element. Two
nested loops
O(2^n) Exponential- recursive algorithms that solves a problem of size N
O(n!) Factorial- you are adding a loop for every element you are inputing. It is most horrible and have steepest BigO graph. As it perform several operation for even a single input.s
Iterating through half a collection is still O(n)
Two separate collections: O(a * b)

****-What can cause time in a function?-
Operations (+, -, *, /)
Comparisons (<, >, ==)
Looping (for, while)
Outside Function call (function())
*********-Rule Book
Rule 1: Always worst Case
Rule 2: Remove Constants
Rule 3: Different inputs should have different variables. O(a+b). Let say we looping over A and B array but they are not nested. Simply two loops or two functions are running in a single function then the Big(O) for such kind of program would be O(a+b).
use + for steps in order
use * for nested steps
Rule 4: Drop Non-dominant terms


******Explanation
you do not need to calculate Big O to such precision O(3+4n). You can simply write it as O(n)

There are 4 rules that you have to follow:
1) Worst case: Always take the worst case. Worst case here is that assume how long or how many max as much as operations can be performed by the given function. Function will be given in generic manner. You should try to put bigger input or the way the function will be maximum operate. It is same as testing any thing at peak conditions. e.g finding a word in an array. So keep the word at last in the array so that function iterate over all the entries.
2) Removing constants: Remove constant values from you answer such as for O(2n) make it O(n) for O(2n+3) make it O(n)
3) Different terms of inputs: In case of more than one input in a function then their operations will be add such as anyFunction(input1, input2) //output: (n+m). And for nested loops you will have n^2. For three nested loop it will be n^3 and so on.
4) Drop non dominants: Drop the terms which have not any significant effect on the final answer such as O(n^2+2n+100+n) here n^2 is the most dominant term and will have effect on the number of operations so keep n^2 and delete rest of the terms so final answer: O(n^2)


*******************Why we are stuying Big(O)
"Data Structures are simply used to store data and algorithms are the way to use those data structures to write good programs"

DSA will give you a way to think like a good programmer. A good programmer is one, who choose write data struture and choose right algorithm to wirte a good program which is readable and scalable.

And good developer have this knowledge to choose right data structure and right algorithm. 

Big(O) notation will help you to find the efficiency of your program. Whether it is scalable or not. In big companies, inputs are huge so we have to focus on number of operations in a program.

There are two factors of scalabilty. One is speed (time complexity: How fast and scalable our code is) and other is memory (Space complexity: How much space it is carrying in the memory?)

lets discuss each in detail

****************Space complexity
When a program executes there are two ways to remember things. One is heap (where variables are stores) and stack (where we keep track of our function calls). Sometimes we want to use less memory instead of using less time and sometimes we want to use less time instead of less memory. Each thing comes at some cost. We have to compromise on one another.

************What causes Space complexity?
Variables
Data Structures
Function Call
Allocations

**************How Big(O) and space complexity are related?
Lets understand this with an example:
Let say you have an array:

const Tweet_array = [
{tweet: 'hi', date: 2013},
{tweet: 'hello', date: 2017},
{tweet: 'teddy', date: 2024},
]

Your job is to compare each tweet with each date of all elements in an array.

Here you can have an idea that you will create a function that will contain nested loop and we know that for nested loop BigO is O(n^2)

And we all know according to BigO notation analysis chart we O(n^2) comes under a dangrous domain. So here we can use our space complexity like we can create some variables, data structures, function calls or allocation to reduce the Big O notation for this task. Here we are doing trading. We are using space to increase our program fast and efficient. 
variables, data structures, functions calls and allocations can help us to make such an efficient program such that its BigO is either time constant or O(n) which lies in good range.

*******One more important thing
> '434345323289hfuhc4389hf'.length

what is the BigO of above program?
the answer to this above program can vary accoding to your language. Different languages can have different programs written to calculate length of an array. Their BigO can vary according to that.

*****************

Always remember, good programmer is one who keeps the balance between scalability, readability and speed. Some times you have to compromise on readability to optimize speed. make sure to have balance between them. 

Managing time and space complexity using Big(O) can save a lot of money and time.

************************How to solve coding problems

The 3 pillars of good code:
1. Readable
2. Time Complexity
3. Space Complexity

What skills interviewer is looking for:
Analytic Skills - How can you think through problems and analyze things?
Coding Skills - Do you code well, by writing clean, simple, organized, readable code?
Technical knowledge - Do you know the fundamentals of the job you're applying for?
Communication skills: Does your personality match the companiesâ€™ culture?


**IMPORTANT**: Whenever an interviewer asks you a question, never ever jump to the solution directly. First of all understand the question. each and every aspect of a question. First solution came into your mind is not always be a good solution. You can tell them that this can be done in that way but thats not the efficent solution as its Big O is not linear or contant and blah blah. then think loudly in front the interviewer. let him know about your thought process. And once you made all logic and stuff then start do coding. One you write the code. Start testing it first with the given inputs and then also test is for edge cases such as what if the input becomes empty or what if the input becomes too large and so on.
prove him that you have analytical skills by analysing the problem, prove him you have coding skills by writing clean, readable, scalable and efficient code, prove him you have technical knowledge by assuming hardware related or company related information. Explain your solution and prove your communication.
*********

Step By Step through a problem:
1. When the interviewer says the question, write down the key points at the top (i.e. sorted array). Make sure you have all the details. Show how organized you are.
2. Make sure you double check: What are the inputs? What are the outputs?
3. What is the most important value of the problem? Do you have time, and space and memory, etc.. What is the main goal?
4. Don't be annoying and ask too many questions.
5. Start with the naive/brute-force (here native/brute-force attack means that the easiest solution but not efficient. It is usually the one which come into your mind at first sight) approach. First thing that comes into mind. It shows that youâ€™re able to think well and critically (you don't need to write this code, just speak about it).
6. Tell them why this approach is not the best (i.e. O(n^2) or higher, not readable, etc...)
7. Walk through your approach, comment things and see where you may be able to break things. Any repetition, bottlenecks like O(N^2), or unnecessary work? Did you use all the information the interviewer gave you? Bottleneck is the part of the code with the biggest Big O. Focus on that. Sometimes this occurs with repeated work as well.
8. Before you start coding, walk through your code and write down the steps you are going to follow.
9. Modularize your code from the very beginning. Break up your code into beautiful small pieces and add just comments if you need to.
10. Start actually writing your code now. Keep in mind that the more you prepare and understand what you need to code, the better the whiteboard will go. So never start a whiteboard interview not being sure of how things are going to work out. That is a recipe for disaster. Keep in mind: A lot of interviews ask questions that you wonâ€™t be able to fully answer on time. So think: What can I show in order to show that I can do this and I am better than other coders. Break things up in Functions (if you canâ€™t remember a method, just make up a function and you will at least have it there. Write something, and start with the easy part.
11. Think about error checks and how you can break this code. Never make assumptions about the input. Assume people are trying to break your code and that Darth Vader is using your function. How will you safeguard it? Always check for false inputs that you donâ€™t want. Here is a trick: Comment in the code, the checks that you want to doâ€¦ write the function, then tell the interviewer that you would write tests now to make your function fail (but you won't need to actually write the tests).
12. Donâ€™t use bad/confusing names like i and j. Write code that reads well.
13. Test your code: Check for no params, 0, undefined, null, massive arrays, async code, etcâ€¦ Ask the interviewer if we can make assumption about the code. Can you make the answer return an error? Poke holes into your solution. Are you repeating yourself?
14. Finally talk to the interviewer where you would improve the code. Does it work? Are there different approaches? Is it readable? What would you google to improve? How can performance be improved? Possibly: Ask the interviewer what was the most interesting solution you have seen to this problem
15. If your interviewer is happy with the solution, the interview usually ends here. It is also common that the interviewer asks you extension questions, such as how you would handle the
problem if the whole input is too large to fit into memory, or if the input arrives as a stream. This is a common follow-up question at Google, where they care a lot about scale. The answer is usually a divide-and-conquer approachâ€Šâ€”â€Šperform distributed processing of the data and only read certain chunks of the input from disk into memory, write the output back to disk and combine them later


****************Data Structures
Data strutures are organised collection of values. You can think Data Structures are like storages such as school bag, fridge, box, drawer. Each thing has its own purpose. Like school bag is for books, fridge is for food, drawer is for clothes etc.
I practical life we human do the same, we organised unordered data into ordered data and store it somewhere to use them. There are tons of data structures in computer's world. 

******How computer stores Data?
we all know Computer consists on a CPU, RAM, and storage device.

CPU access the RAM.
When we create variable such as var a = 7 then it stores in the RAM in the form of 0s and 1s. As RAM have direct access to each address of the objects or variables stores in the RAM.

each integer is represented by 8 bits in RAM if your system is of 8bits. And 8bits are combined to form a byte.

8 bit
16
32
64
more the bits of your system are, more you are going store a lot of information.

The reason by Data structures are important cause they effect space complexity in memory. When you will console a number such as 5^1000 you will get infinity. As There is a certain threshhold of a data struture to store a variable. If the size of the variable exceeds the threshold of then it will show infinity. So the choice of right data structure is important.

*******Data Structures:
Arrays
Trees
Stacks
Queues
Linked List
Trees
Tries
Graph 
Hash tables

********Algorithms
Sorting
Dynamic Programming
BFS + DFS (For searching)
Recursion

**NOTE**: Each language has its own data types, data structures are used to store those data types. 

************Operations of Data Structures
There are some operations that we are going to perform on our data structures
Each data structure has its pros and cons while performing the following operations: (and we know pros and cons will be on the basis of Big O notation)

1) Insertion (adding data into data structures)
2) Deletion (deleting data from memory)
3) Access (accessing the data from memory)
4) Traversal (Accessing each item exactly once)
5) Searching (Searching a matching word)
6) Sorting (organizing data in ascending or descending order)

Some data structures are shows accepateble big O over performing above operations and some Data structures shows bad.
Your job is to choose the right Data Structure for your operation and algorithm.


*************Arrays
Arrays are most used data struture and simply used to store data sequentially. Arrays have some pros and cons.
1) lookup (accessing data) O(1)
2) push (adding data at the end) O(1)
3) Insert (inserting data at start or inbetween) O(n)
4) Delete (Deleting data from start or in between) O(n)
5) searching O(n)

*********Arrays in JS
const myArr = ['a','b','c','d'];
// here if 'a' is carrying 4 bytes in the memory then myArray will carry 4*5=20 bytes of space in memory.

myArr[2] //O(1) Accessing data using arrays is very fast no matter how long the array is. Our computer exactly knows where it is.

myArr.push('e') //O(1) adding items are the end of array is very fast as we know we dont have to loop over the array

myArr.pop() // O(1) removes last item

myArr.unshift('x') // O(n) this methods add item at the start of an array the reason why its time complexity is O(n) cuz after adding element at the start we have to assign new indexes to 		      the whole array
myArr.splice(2, 0, 'alien') // O(n) Splice can be used to delete and add data anywhere in the array. Since again we are adding in between. so we have to reassign the new indexes to the 			      whole array element by looping over it.

************Types of Arrays
there are two types of arrays:
1) Static : In static arrays we define the fixed size of an array before creating it. Means we are allocating a fixed space in the memory in advance. In languages like C++ we create static  	    arrays like this > int arr[4] {1,2,3,4}; here we can manage memory at low level. But in higher lvl languages like python and JS we do not need to worry about memory management 	    as JS and python deals with dynamic arrays.
2) Dynamic : Dynamic arrays are the one who do not have fixed space. They manage their size according to the number of elements in them.

// there are some cases where you have to manually manage the memory but there are some cases where you dont.


**************Implementing/creating Arrays from scratch
We can create our own data strutures and their customs methods.
In JS we will be using Objects/classes to create such data strutures


class MyArray {

    constructor() {
        this.length = 0;
        this.data = {};
    }

    get(index) {
        return this.data[index];
    }

    push(item) {
        this.data[this.length] = item;
        this.length++;

        return this.length;
    }

    pop() {
        const lastItem = this.data[this.length - 1];

        delete this.data[this.length - 1];
        this.length--;

        return lastItem;
    }

    delete(index) {
        const item = this.data[index];

        this.shiftItems(index);

        return item;
    }

    shiftItems(index) {
        for (let i = index; i < this.length; i++) {
            this.data[i] = this.data[i + 1];
        }

        delete this.data[this.length - 1];
        this.length--;
    }
}

const newArray = new MyArray();

newArray.push("hi");
newArray.push("you");
newArray.push("!");

newArray.pop();

newArray.delete(1);

console.log(newArray);


// custom insert method

class myArray {
  constructor() {
    this.array = [];
    this.length = 0;
  }
  append(value) {
    this.array.push(value);
    this.length++;
    // console.log(this.array);
    return this;
  }
  insert(index, value) {
    if (index < 0 || index > this.length) {
      this.array.append(value);
      console.log(this.array);
      return this.array;
    }

    for (let i = this.length; i > index; i--) {
      //shifting elements to one step ahead to their index to create empty space of this coming value
      this.array[i] = this.array[i - 1];
    }
    this.array[index] = value;
    this.length++;
    console.log(this.array);

    return this.array;
  }
}

const arr = new myArray();

arr.append(5);
arr.append(4);
arr.append(6);
arr.append(8);
arr.insert(2, 99);


**********Reversing an array
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
function reverse(arr) {
  let revArr = [];

  for (i = arr.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
    revArr.push(arr[i]);
  }
  console.log(revArr);
  return revArr;
}

reverse(arr);

**********************Strings vs Arrays
*************************Strings questions
whenever you got questions related to strings then treat them like an array. Cause at the end of the day strings are also an array.
First covert strings into array using some operations then solve your question what the interviewer has asked.

**JS Recall: 
The split() method splits a string into an array of substrings.

The split() method returns the new array.

The split() method does not change the original string.

If (" ") is used as separator, the string is split between words.

***Example:
const str = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';

const words = str.split(' ');
console.log(words);
// Expected output:  ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog."]

const chars = str.split('');
console.log(chars);
// Expected output: ["T", "h", "e", " ", "q", "u", "i", "c", "k", " ", "b", "r", "o", "w", "n", " ", "f", "o", "x", " ", "j", "u", "m", "p", "s", " ", "o", "v", "e", "r", " ", "t", "h", "e", " ", "l", "a", "z", "y", " ", "d", "o", "g", "."]

const strCopy = str.split();
console.log(strCopy);
// Expected output: Array ["The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."]

**********
**********Reversing a string

// const str = 'Hi my name is Andrie';

//using builtin method
// function reverse(str) {
//   const char = str.split('');
//   const reversedArr = char.reverse();
//   const final = reversedArr.join(' ');
//   console.log(final);
// }

// reverse(str);

//creating from scratch
// function reverse(str) {
//   const reversedArr = [];
//   const totalItems = str.length - 1;

//   for (i = totalItems; i >= 0; i--) {
//     reversedArr.push(str[i]);
//   }
//   const final = reversedArr.join('');
//   console.log(final);
// }

// reverse(str);

****************Hash Functions
These are the functions which generates are 16 digit code on even entering a single value.
No matter we enter same string every time we always get the same output code.

Entering same string and getting the same code corresponding to the input is called idempotent.
Hash functions are really fast therefore their BigO is counted as O(1)

Similarly we have a data structure called Hash Tables or Objects in JS
Why we discussed hash functions first?

The reason is to make logic. Hash functions generate random keys. Same as Hash table stores its items in the  memory randomly. There is no sequential order. 

In hash tables /Objects we can have collisions of data. Means that on inserting data in the Obj/hash tables two items get placed at the same address. So how we will solve this issue with Hash tables/objects? To solve collision issue we have another data structure called linked list. There are some other solutions are there too.


There are two other types called Maps and Sets
The difference between Maps and hash tables (objs) is that in maps data is sequentially stores and any data type can be the key. Where as in Hash tables (Obj) only strings can become keys. 

In sets we can only stores keys.


NOTE: In Hash tables 
Insert O(1)
lookup O(1)
update O(1)
delete O(1)

but collision of data in hash tables makes it slower.

*******************Implementing/creating Hash tables (Objects) from scratch

class HashTable {
  constructor(size) {
    this.data = new Array(size);
  }

  _hash(key) {
    let hash = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
      hash = (hash + key.charCodeAt(i) * i) % this.data.length;
    }
    return hash;
  }

  set(key, value) {
    const address = this._hash(key);
    if (!this.data[address]) {
      this.data[address] = [];
    }
    this.data[address].push([key, value]);
    return this.data;
  }

  get(key) {
    const address = this._hash(key);
    const currentBucket = this.data[address];
    if (currentBucket) {
      for (const i = 0; i < currentBucket.length; i++) {
        if (currentBucket[i][0] === key) {
          return currentBucket[i][0];
        }
      }
    }
  }

  keys() {
    const keysArray = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < this.data.length; i++) {
      if (this.data[i]) {
        keysArray.push(this.data[i][0][0]);
      }
    }
    console.log(keysArray);
    return keysArray;
  }
}

const myHashTable = new HashTable(50);
myHashTable.set('grapes', 10000);
myHashTable.set('oranges', 873);
myHashTable.set('bananas', 10000);
myHashTable.set('apples', 9);
myHashTable.get('grapes');
myHashTable.get('apples');
myHashTable.keys();

//here get, set, and Hash function all have O(1) despite having loops in them in case of collision O(n)


//again here we are creating a data struture which works as Hash tables like when it stores things it assign some random address which we are doing using hash functions and then using hash functions address we are using accessing it. WE have created set and get methods for our Object/hash table.


**NOTE:** Why we created Hash tables and arrays from scratch? The answer is that we did this all so that we could have an idea how things work behind the scenes. Here we learned how to create data structures from scratch using Classes in JS and then their methods which we apply on them.


// prevention of Hash/ Object collision (more than one element of the hash table have same memory address)

 keys() {
    if (!this.data.length) {
      return undefined
    }
    let result = []
    // loop through all the elements
    for (let i = 0; i < this.data.length; i++) {
        // if it's not an empty memory cell
        if (this.data[i] && this.data[i].length) {
          // but also loop through all the potential collisions
          if (this.data.length > 1) {
            for (let j = 0; j < this.data[i].length; j++) {
              result.push(this.data[i][j][0])
            }
          } else {
            result.push(this.data[i][0])
          } 
        }
    }
    return result; 
  }

***********************Arrays Vs Hash Tables (Obj)
**Arrays:
Search O(n)
lookup O(1)
push   O(1)
insert O(n) (inserting element at any random point except starting and ending of an array)
delete O(n) (deleting element from any random point except starting and ending of an array)

Hash Tables (Objects)
Search O(1)
lookup O(1)
insert O(1) 
delete O(1) 
(In hash tables/obj we can store data anywhere in the memory. therefore we do not have any sequential indexes which makes its inertion and deletion O(1))

The reason why Hash Tables are fast is due to their non-sequential order of storing elements. Instead of Arrays where every thing is ordered so we have to assign indexes. In Hash Tables this is not the thing.

Hash tables are used to optimize the programs as in the below example we have reduced our O(n^2) to O(n). But here we compromised over space complexity. In hash tables we have to compromise on space complexity but time complexity can be improve.

// Method 1 having big O(n^2)
// function firstRecurringCharacter(input) {
//   for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
//     for (let j = i + 1; j < input.length; j++) {
//       if (input[i] === input[j]) {
//         return input[i];
//       }
//     }
//   }
//   return undefined;
// }

// // Method 2 having big O(n)
// function firstRecurringCharacter2(input) {
//   let map = {};
//   for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
//     if (map[input[i]] !== undefined) {
//       return input[i];
//     } else {
//       map[input[i]] = i;
//     }
//   }
//   return undefined;
// }

// firstRecurringCharacter2([1, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4, 6]);



Hash Tables pros and cons

**pros:
really fast lookups
fast inserts
flexible keys

**cons:
unordered
slow key iteration

***********************Linked Lists
We have seen problems with arrays as in case of static we had fixed space. Then We used dynamic arrays. But dynamic arrays we not efficient for deleting and inserting data. Then we used Hash tables which stores data anywhere in the memory which makes our deletion and insertion easy. But hash tables had  collision of data problem (multiple elements having same address in the memory) To solve these issues we will use our third data structure which is called Linked List. So what does that means linked list is the best data sturture and we always have to used linked list instead of using arrays and hash tables? NO, we all know Data structures comes with a trade off. (trade off means we have to compromise on one in order to achieve other).


What is a linked list?
Linked list is a data structure which contains two values. One which our actual data of any type and other the pointer pointing toward the next node.
In linked list we have nodes. One node is pointing toward the other node.
Example of a linked list

apples
5678 ----> grapes
	   91011 ---->bananas
 		      121314 ----> null

In linked list we have head node and a tail node. Tail node the one whos pointer points towards the null (as its the end of the list and there is no further nodes)
In Javascript we do not have pre-built linked list data struture. We have to build it. In languages like Java and C we have pre-built linked lists.


***********Big Os of Linked list
prepend O(1) (adding item at the beginning of an array)
append O(1) (adding item at the end of an array)
lookup O(n) (For linked list we have to use loop to lookup/get a specific item)
insert O(n) (For insert we have to use loop to get the element behind the index where we want to insert out element)
delete O(n) 

In Linked list we again have to loop over the whole array to search a specific element.
In case of inserting we have to change the pointers and same case of deletion.

*****************What is a pointer
Pointers are simply references that are just pointing toward some value or data type.
In JS we also create pointers. (We do not have pre-built pointers but it happens behind the scenes in JS)
For example:

const obj1 = {a:true};
const obj2 = obj1;

here obj2 is a pointer which is pointing toward obj1.

In memory there is only 1 "{a:true}" and both obj1 and obj2 are pointing towards the same data in memory.

If we modify obj1 then obj2 will be modified cuz actually there is only one object in the memory other is the pointer.
If we do something like this

let obj1 = {a:true};
let obj2 = obj1;

delete obj1;
obj2 = "myString";

console.log(obj2)

//output: "myString"

here now obj2 will have this data "myString". As Obj1 was deleted but its data {a:true} was still there as Obj2 was a pointer and pointing towards the {a:true}. But later on we assigned obj2 this data "myString" so this data --> {a:true}will be deleted automatically from the memory as now no one is pointing toward it. Therefore we say, In JS we have


*****************Implementing LinkedList alomg with its methods
Example of how a linkedList looks like:
{value: 10, 
 next: {
	value:50
	next: {
		value: 60
		next: null
		}		
}
}


******Coding: Linked List
class node {
  constructor(value) {
    (this.value = value), (this.next = null);
  }
}

class linkedList {
  constructor(value) {
    this.head = {
      value: value,
      next: null,
    };
    this.tail = this.head;
    this.length = 1;
  }
  append(value) {
    const newNode = new node(value);
    this.tail.next = newNode;
    this.tail = newNode;
    this.length++;
    console.log(this);
  }

  prepend(value) {
    const newNode = new node(value);
    newNode.next = this.head;
    this.head = newNode;
    this.length++;
    console.log(this);
  }

  printList() {
    const arr = [];
    let currentNode = this.head;
    while (currentNode !== null) {
      arr.push(currentNode.value);
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }
    console.log(arr);
  }

  insert(index, value) {
    if (index >= this.length) {
      return this.append(value);
    }
    const newNode = new node(value);

    //grabbing the entry which is one step behind the giving index
    const leader = this.grabLeaderWithItsPointer(index - 1);
    //holding "next/pointer" object of the leader entry
    const holdingPointer = leader.next;
    //setting "next/pointer" of the leader entry to point to the new coming node
    leader.next = newNode;
    //pointing the next of the new coming node to the holding pointer which contains the rest of the linked list
    newNode.next = holdingPointer;
    //incrementing the length
    this.length++;

    console.log(this);

    return this;
  }
  grabLeaderWithItsPointer(index) {
    let counter = 0;
    const currentNode = this.head;
    while (counter !== index) {
      currentNode = currentNode.next; //using this we are going deeper and deeper in the list
      counter++;
    }
    return currentNode;
  }

  remove(index) {
    if (index >= this.length) {
      return this.append(value);
    }
    const leader = this.grabLeaderWithItsPointer(index - 1);
    const targetNode = leader.next; //targetNode is a node which we want to delete
    //here below we are pointing our leader pointer to the node which is next to the targetNode
    leader.next = targetNode.next;
    this.length--;

    return this;
  }
}

const myLinkedList = new linkedList(10);
myLinkedList.append(5);
myLinkedList.prepend(1);
myLinkedList.insert(1, 99);
myLinkedList.remove(1);
myLinkedList.printList();


***************Doubly Linked list
Doubly linked lists are exactly same as singly linked list but the difference is that we have additional pointer which points towards the previous list. This way now we can have reference from end to the start of the list.


Big Os of Doubly linked list
prepend O(1) (adding item at the beginning of an array)
append O(1) (adding item at the end of an array)
lookup O(n) (For linked list we have to use loop to lookup/get a specific item) (technically its O(n/2))
insert O(n) (For insert we have to use loop to get the element behind the index where we want to insert out element)
delete O(n) 



****************Singly Linked list vs Doubly Linked list
Both have their own pros and cos
Both are fast in terms of time complexity
But singly lists are good for space complexity as they carry less space whereas Doubly list carries some additional pointer so they carry some more space.

Doubly list can be iterate in the reverse direction as it has pointer referencing to the previous object. So providing some more flexibility to perform operations.
Both are good for prepends, appends.




************Reversing linked list
//rest of the code...
reverse() {
    if (!this.head.next) {
      return this.head;
    }

    let first = this.head; //grabbing the first item
    this.tail = this.head; //swapping the firt and last
    let second = first.next; //grabbing the second item
    //below we are swapping the pointers
    while (second) {
      const temp = second.next; //here second.next is the 3rd item
      second.next = first; //replacing 4th (last in this case) with the 1st item
      first = second;
      second = temp;
    }
    this.head.next = null;
    this.head = first;
    return this.printList();
  }
}

//rest of the code...



**************Linked list pros and cons
**Pros
Fast Insertion
Fast Deletion
Ordered
Flexible size

**cons:
Slow lookup (as we have to go deep and deep inside the nested list)
More memory (due to pointers they carry more space)


************Stacks and Queues

**Stacks:
Stacks are the data structures which are very powerful and only allow few operations. These are the data strutures which are made on the top of low level data strutures.

You can think stacks like a stack of plates you cannot access the last plate. To reach there you have to go step by step through each plate.

Imagine stack as you are putting blocks in a box. (Push operation)
And when you take out he blocks the block which was put most recent would be on the top and you will take that first out (pop operation)
There are few operations that are as follow:
Lookup() O(n)
pop() O(1)
push() O(1)
peek() O(1)

It works on the principle of FILO means "First in last out".
There are many application and features which are build on the FILO architecture. For example, undo feature in which we stores our previous operations in the memory and can be access by undo operation and same case for our browser history and swithcing of tabs are done by using the concept of stacks.


**Queues:
Queues are the data structure same as stacks but the difference is that they works on FIFO (First In First Out) architechture instead of FILO.
Its application are in riding booking app such as Uber. The one who requested first will be give a priority. 

Imagin queue as hollow pipe and you are inserting balls in the hollow pipe which is opened at the both ends. (push/enqueue operation)
Now the ball which entered into the pipe first will get out of the other hand first and then so on. (pop/dequeue operation)

Lookup O(n)
enqueue O(1) (push)
dequeue O(1) (pop but here pop deletes the first person not last)
peek O(1)



****************Implementing Stack and queues in JS
Since we know that JS dont come with a built in stack and queue methods. We have to build them. In JS we can do either with arrays or linkedlist.

Which one should we use to build arrays? or linkedlist?

since we know that in case of Array elements are next to each other in the memory. But memory in case of arrays is limited. And we all know in case of adding or removing element at the start of the array is a big O(n) operation like we have to shift their indexes as well.

Where as in case of linked list every element is scattered or can be anywhere in the memory they are linked with a pointer. Which took some extra space but we can add as many elements in linked list as we want. 

Linked list offers a very fast operation for insertion as all we have to do is simply just to change the head and tail rest will be done automatically. Since Linked list offer O(1) insertion operation therefore we will go with this.

To understand Stack lets understand how JS works behind the scenes:

*************How JS works

We have 4 things in javascript run time environment

memory heap: the place where we allocate the memory to all our variables and Data structures that we have created or our program use.
call stack:  this is a place where our code get runs step by step as each line is a thread in JS and each line get executed as a stack 
web API: This is a place we asynchronous code get deal with.
call back queue: This place deals with the callback functions
Event loop: This event loop keep checking the call stack that is there any process in call stack if no, then it run call back there.

Example:
console.log('1')
setTimeOut(()=>{console.log('2')}, 2000}
console.log('3')


// output 1, 3, 2

setTimeOut is a web API task therefore it will be moved to Web API then Callback and then event loop and then to call stack after 2000 mili seconds. This is how asynchronous JS code works. This is how JS is a single thread non blocking language.

Multi-thread languages are no doubt very efficient but they can cause some issues like Dead-lock


Example 2:
console.log('1')
setTimeOut(()=>{console.log('2')}, 0}
console.log('3')


// output 1, 3, 2

// NO matter your time is 0 in setTimeOut JS will still pass setTimeOut code through web API --> Callback --> event loop. Therefore it will get printed after other thread executed during that time. 


****************Stack vs Queue
***Stack
1) Stack works on LIFO principle.
2) Objects are inserted and removed from the same end that is end/top of the list/stack. 
3) Insert operation is called push.
4) Delete operation is called pop
5) In stack there is NO wastage of memory scope. (There is minimal wastage of memory since elements are inserted and removed from the same end, and there is no need for additional pointers or references)

***Queue
1) Stack works on FIFO principle.
2) Objects are inserted at the end (tail) of the list and removed from the start (head) of list.
3) Insert operation is called enqueue.
4) Delete operation is called dequeue.
5) In stack there is a wastage of memory scope. (Wastage of memory may occur due to the need for extra space to maintain references or pointers to the front and rear elements. This extra space is often required to allow for efficient insertion and deletion operations.)

// ******************Implementing stack data structure using linked list

class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class stack {
  constructor() {
    this.top = null;
    this.bottom = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }
  peek() {
    return this.top;
  }
  push(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    if (this.length === 0) {
      this.top = newNode;
      this.bottom = newNode;
    } else {
      const holdingPointer = this.top;
      this.top = newNode;
      this.top.next = holdingPointer;
    }
    this.length++;
    console.log(this);
    return this;
  }
  pop() {
    if (!this.top) {
      return null;
    }
    if (this.top === this.bottom) {
      this.bottom = null;
    }
    this.top = this.top.next;
    this.length--;
    console.log(this);
    return this;
  }
}

const myStack = new stack();

myStack.push('google');
myStack.push('udemy');
myStack.push('youtube');
myStack.peek();
myStack.pop();
myStack.pop();



// ******************Implementing stack data structure using arrays

class stack {
  constructor() {
    this.array = [];
  }
  peek() {
    return this.array[this.array.length - 1];
  }
  push(value) {
    this.array.push(value);

    console.log(this);

    return this;
  }
  pop() {
    this.array.pop();

    console.log(this);

    return this;
  }
}

const myStack = new stack();

myStack.peek();
myStack.push('google');
myStack.push('udemy');
myStack.push('youtube');
myStack.peek();
myStack.pop();
myStack.pop();
myStack.pop();

// ******************Implementing Queue using stacks (and we will build stacks using arrays)

class queue {
  constructor() {
    this.first = [];
    this.last = [];
    this.length = 0;
  }
  peek() {
    if (this.first.length > 0) {
      return this.first[this.first.length - 1];
    }
    return this.last[0];
  }
  enqueue(value) {
    const length = this.first.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      this.last.push(this.first.pop());
    }
    this.last.push(value);
    console.log(this);
    return this;
  }
  dequeue() {
    
    const length = this.first.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      this.first.push(this.last.pop());
    }
    this.first.pop(value);
    console.log(this);
    return this;
  }
}

const myQueue = new queue();

myQueue.peek();
myQueue.enqueue('google');
myQueue.enqueue('udemy');
myQueue.enqueue('youtube');
myQueue.dequeue();
myQueue.dequeue();


********Pros and cons of Stacks and queues
**Pros:
Fast seek operation
fast push and pop

**Cons:
slower lookups (or search operation)

**NOTE: We do not get all the items in the stack or queue. We are just access to the first or last and since they are built on the top of lower level data structure such as linkedlist so their elements are connected to each other.


*****************Trees
Trees are also a very powerful data structure. You might have heard about AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
These are the trees which our machine break down to take decision. Lets have a look below about a tree. Here you can see there is only a single root and then it is spreading like a tree.

	    1 
	   / \
	  4   3	
	 / \
	6   4

There are so many trees out there. We will learn about those only which will be used 90% of the time. 

***********Binary Trees
As we all know binary means 2. So in binary trees we can only have either 0 1 or 2 nodes with a parent node.
There won't be a case where there are more than 2 nodes are coming from one parent node. Example of binar tree is given below:

	     9 
	   /    \
	  4      5      	
	 / \    /  \
	1   8  3    7

This kind of Binary tree is called as PERFECT BINARY TREE.
perfect binary trees are the efficient one and there number of nodes are getting double when we move each step down.
And the nodes at the bottom are equals to all nodes above + 1. By using this mathematical relation we can do something for the efficiency of the array.

	     1 
	   /    \
	  4      3	
	 / \    
	6   4      
	   / \
	  8   9

Such kind of binary trees are called FULL BINARY TREE.

In Binary trees we have three parameters:

value
left node
right node

**********Big O of Balanced Binary Search Tree
lookup O(log N)
insert O(log N)
delete O(log N)

Lets understand what is Log N in this binary search tree.
Remember O(Log N) is better and more efficient than O(n).

How can we calculate number of nodes at each level of our tree?

level 0 : 2^0 = 1 node
level 1 : 2^1 = 2 nodes
level 2 : 2^2 = 4
level 3 : 2^3 = 8
level 4 : 2^4 = 16

How to calulate total nodes?

Total number of nodes in perfectly binary tree = 2^h-1

where h = height of binary tree and h is also Log N

log 100 = 2 (cuz 10^2=100, so log 10^2=> 2log10 => 2(1) => 2)

************Binary Search trees
Binary Search trees are the subset of binary trees. Binary search trees allows us to efficeintly search the data which we are looking for. 
But dont hash maps/tables/Obj were providing us the same benefit? Like we just simply have to pass a key and it will return us a value. But we have to remember that Hash maps/tables/obj do not have relation in between they do not persist relations. On the other hand Binary Search trees provide us the relation and efficient search of Bigo(Log N)
****RUles for binary Search trees
1) Whem we move right down side of the tree. The node number will increase. And if we move left down of the tree the number will decrease.
2) Each not cannot have more than two nodes in Binary search tree as its name suggest Binary means 2.

These two rules will help us to perform Insert, delete and search operations on Binary search trees.
When we insert an element in a BST it first look for the right place for that coming number according to rule number 1 and then place it there.

we have discussed the above the pros of binary trees. Let discuss some cons of it.

The problem that we can may face is that our binary tree can be unbalanced int this way in adapt a shape of linked list of array where we have to loop over to access the desired item.

***In case of unbalaned tree our Big O will be
lookup O(n)
insert O(n)
delete O(n)

Example of unbalanced binary tree is:

	     6 
	   /   \
	  4     8	
	 / \     \
	2   7     11
	   / \	   \
	  1   9     14
		      \
		       17

you can see the right side is becoming a form of linked list or array which are inefficient for seacrh operations. To solve such unbalance problem we have some algorithms to solve such problems


PROS AND CONS of BST
1) Better than O(n), as we have O(log N)
2) Ordered
3) Flexible size

CONS
There is no O(1) operation
No O(1) operations

          leftmostParent.left = leftmost.right;
          leftmost.left = currentNode.left;
          leftmost.right = currentNode.right;

          if (parentNode === null) {
            this.root = leftmost;
          } else {
            if (currentNode.value < parentNode.value) {
              parentNode.left = leftmost;
            } else if (currentNode.value > parentNode.value) {
              parentNode.right = leftmost;
            }
          }
        }

const tree = new BinarySearchTree();
tree.insert(9);
tree.insert(4);
tree.insert(6);
tree.insert(20);
tree.insert(170);
tree.insert(15);
tree.insert(1);
tree.remove(170);
JSON.stringify(traverse(tree.root));
console.log(tree.lookup(20));
//     9
//  4     20
//1  6  15  170

function traverse(node) {
  const tree = { value: node.value };
  tree.left = node.left === null ? null : traverse(node.left);
  tree.right = node.right === null ? null : traverse(node.right);
  return tree;
}

***************TVL Trees and Red black trees
These are the trees which are self balanced. They do balance them self automatically by using some sort of algorithm. For better understanding of these Trees visit: visualgo


*********Binary Heap Trees
Binary Heap trees are same as as Binary Search trees but the difference is that as we go down the value of the lower node will always be less than the value of the parent node.

NOTE: Dont mix heap trees with heap memory which most of the programming languages have.
example:
	     9 
	   /    \
	  4      5      	
	 / \    /  \
	1   2  3    7

This is an example of BST here you can see left down right value is decreasing and right down value is increasing.

BHT (Binary Heap tree) example:

	     9 
	   /    \
	  6      5      	
	 / \    /  \
	1   2  8    7

Here there is no concept of left is smaller than right. In BHT the only thing we have is the decreasing value from top to bottom. It is also called Max Binary Heap tree.
In Min Binary Heap tree it is reversed. Value drease from top to bottom.

*******Big O of BHT

lookup O(n)
insert O(logN)
delete O(logN)

BHTs are used in sorting algorithms

*********why do we need BHTs? 
To understand this why do we need such type of data structures we first have to understand priority queues.


********Priority Queue
In Priority queue the element that have higher priority will be allowed to got first. 

In Max binary heap we have highest value on the top and for min binary heap we have lowest value on th top. Binary heap is a data struture which is very very useful when you want get highest or lowest value. They will balanced as we have no restriction in putting left of right.


Pros and Cons of BHT:

They are better than O(n).
More Flexible
priority
Fast insert

Cons:

slower lookup O(n)

*************Trie

Trie  is a data structure mostly used to store alphabets or words in a tree. The are for searching strings 

The big O is dependent on the length of the word that we are searching for.

The are good for space complexity. We do not need to store two words separately starting with the same letter. We can have them in a common node.

******************

NOTE: There are several trees out there. At the end of the day they all are trees with some different rules of storing data.

**************Graphs
Image graphs as network. Where there are several nodes connecting to each other.
Linked list are the types of trees and trees are the types of graphs.

Google uses graphs to find the shortest path. Facebook used graphs for their social network.

************Types of graphs
Since there are a lot of graphs but we can differentiate them on the basis of some characteristics which are as follow:
1) Directional and undirectional graphs: (In directional graphs you can only go one way and will have arrows, e.g twitter uses Directional graphs as one can follow one, the one do not have 					to follow back. whereas FB use unidirectional graphs as if one is a friend you then you will also be the friend of him)
2) Weighted and unweighted graphs: (Wieghted graphs are those in which we can store information Not only in nodes but in edges as well. They are used to find the shortest or most optimized 					path.) 
3) Cyclic and Acyclic graphs: (Cyclic graphs are those in which elements are connected in the form of a closed loop and you can go back to your initial node. whereas a cyclic do not form 				circle)

NOTE: A graph can be the combination of the above characteristics. For example: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG is very common)

***********Ways to represent graphs
Edge List:
const graph = [[0,2], [2,3], [2,1], [1,3]]
here syntax: [node1, node2]

Adjacent List:
const graph = [[2], [2,3], [0,1,3], [1,2]]

here indexes are the actual value of nodes and array on the index it its neighbour for example:
here at index 0 the node is 2 means that 0 is connected with 2 and so on for others

Adjacent matrix:

const graph = {
  0: [0, 0, 1, 0],
  1: [0, 0, 1, 1],
  2: [1, 1, 0, 1],
  3: [0, 1, 1, 0],
};

here 0 1 2 3 means nodes, and index are the values of the node which is connected or not ( 0 or 1)

0: [0, 0, 1, 0] means that 0 is connected with 2 as there is a 1 showing yes at index 2 here 2 is the value of the node.

Implementing graphs from scratch. Graphs might seems complex to implement but they are very easy. All we gonna do just to fill the below syntax:

{0:[node1, node2]}

class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.numberOfNodes = 0;
    this.adjacentList = {};
  }
  addVertex(node) {
    this.adjacentList[node] = [];
    this.numberOfNodes++;
  }
  addEdge(node1, node2) {
    //undirected Graph
    this.adjacentList[node1].push(node2);
    this.adjacentList[node2].push(node1);
    
  }
  showConnections() {
    const allNodes = Object.keys(this.adjacentList);
    for (let node of allNodes) {
      let nodeConnections = this.adjacentList[node];
      let connections = '';
      let vertex;
      for (vertex of nodeConnections) {
        connections += vertex + ' ';
      }
      console.log(node + '-->' + connections);
    }
  }
}

const myGraph = new Graph();
myGraph.addVertex('0');
myGraph.addVertex('1');
myGraph.addVertex('2');
myGraph.addVertex('3');
myGraph.addVertex('4');
myGraph.addVertex('5');
myGraph.addVertex('6');
myGraph.addEdge('3', '1');
myGraph.addEdge('3', '4');
myGraph.addEdge('4', '2');
myGraph.addEdge('4', '5');
myGraph.addEdge('1', '2');
myGraph.addEdge('1', '0');
myGraph.addEdge('0', '2');
myGraph.addEdge('6', '5');

myGraph.showConnections();
//Answer:
// 0-->1 2
// 1-->3 2 0
// 2-->4 1 0
// 3-->1 4
// 4-->3 2 5
// 5-->4 6
// 6-->5


*******Pros and cons of graphs
Graphs are good for relations. The data which have to some relation. You will use libraries suchas neo4j to make complex data structure like this.
They are hard to scale.


************************Algorithms

What are algorithms? At the end of the day algorithms are simply functions that do some actions on data which we store in data structures that we have learned above.
There are algorithms which we can use to improve our time and space complexity.

Following are the algorithms that we are gonna learn
1) Sorting
2) Dynamic programming
3) BFS + DFS (Searching algorithms)
4) Recursion


**************Recursion
Technically, Recursion is not an algorithm but its a concept which will be using ahead in several alogrithms. It is used in treversing the list. (Traversing means accessing each element of data structure at least once. Linked List traversal means accessing all the elements of the list starting from the head node to the last node. Traversing a tree and graph means visiting every node at least once.)

Recursion is nothing simply calling itself. 

e.g

function myFunc(){
	myfunc();
}

Recurion is used where subtasks are repeating themselves.

*************Problem with recursion

The main problem with the recusion is "Stack Overflow" which means that stack memory where computer allocates some memory the each function which is get calling. Since in recursion computer calls the same function infinite so its memory/stack will get out of memory. 

you can check the stack get fulling using debugger mode in your browser as below:
e.g

function myFunc(){
	myfunc();
}


*********so whats the solution of this problem?
Recursive functions have two paths:
1) Recursive case (infinite)
2) Base case (once objective has achieved stop calling the function)

The solution is to a base case or stop point which we will be using to get of this infinite loop recursion.

e.g
let counter = 0;
function myFunc(){
if (counter > 3){
	return 'done!';
}
counter++
	myfunc();
}

myFunc();

//output: undefined

//
let counter = 0;
function myFunc(){
if (counter > 3){
	return 'done!';
}
counter++
	return myfunc(); //here we must have to use word return so that myFunc return value all the way to the top. See below explanation
}

myFunc();

//output: 'done'

//Anatomy of Recursion
myFunc(myFunc(myFunc(myFunc(myFunc())))) //actually this kind of thing happens in recursion.
 So your most nested function will return the base case value that is 'done!' in this case. This value will keep moving upward upward and upward till the final function. So there for it is important to use "return" before 


***********Rules of making a recursive function

//1. Identify the base case (when to end the loop)
  2. Identify the recursive case (when loop will keep continue)
  3. Get Closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you would have 2 returns ().


*****************Finding Factorial of a number using loop and recursion

// **************** Finding factorial of number using recursion or loop

// using recursion

function findFactorialUsingRecursion(number) {
  if (number == 2) {
    return 2;
  }

  return number * findFactorialUsingRecursion(number - 1);
}

findFactorialUsingRecursion(5);


// ******using for loop
function findFactorialUsingLoop(number) {
  let answer = 1;
  for (i = 2; i <= number; i++) {
    answer = answer * i;
  }
  return answer;
}

findFactorialUsingLoop(5);



Big O for both of the function is O(n).


// *************Implementing Fibonacchi series using iterative method
// using iterative

function createFibonacchi(index) {
  let arr = [0, 1];

  for (i = 0; i < index - 1; i++) {
    nextvalue = arr[i] + arr[i + 1];
    arr.push(nextvalue);
  }
  // console.log(arr);
  return arr[index];
}

console.log(createFibonacchi(1));

// using recursion
function createFibonacchiRecursive(index) {
  if (index < 2) {
    return index;
  }

  return (
    createFibonacchiRecursive(index - 1) + createFibonacchiRecursive(index - 2)
  );
}

console.log(createFibonacchiRecursive(8));

**NOTE**:

Here BigO of itertaive approach is O(n-2) or simply O(n) that is linear time. But the BigO of recursive approach is O(2^n) which is very very bad. Why would we use recursive method which is very complex and have very bad time complexity? we will discuss it later. As we all know everything comes at some trade off.

*************Recursive pros and cons
There is a theorem which says "Anything that can be done by recursion, can also be done using iterative approach (loop)"
Pros:
Recursion code is:
DRY (dont repeat yourself)
Readable

Cons:
But it can use large stack (means everytime a function call take some space in call stack)

But there is an approach called "Tail call optimization" which can be used to free the space of call stack. This technique can be helpful to efficiently.

***********When to use recursion?

Everytime when you are using a tree or converting something into a tree, then consider recursion.

//probelm should have following characteristics, so recursion would be beneficial
1) Divide the problem into subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2) Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature
3) The solution of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem in hand


recursions are widely used in searching algorithms.

********************Sorting
Hey every language have a built-in sorting method. Why dont we use that? 

*********The issue with sort()
That sorting method is not suitable for large data sets. We have to care about Big O.
"Do not trust blindly on your language sort method"
Cause we dont know how the sorting method was implemeneted. Therefore, we recommend to read the documentation of these methods.

Example:
const letters = [2,65, 34, 2, 1,7,8];

console.log(letters.sort())

//Expected : [1, 2, 2, 7, 8, 34, 65]
//Actual Output: [1, 2, 2, 34, 65, 7, 8]

SOlution:

To solve this properly we have to do something like this:
const letters = [2,65, 34, 2, 1,7,8];

console.log(
  letters.sort(function (a, b) {
    return a - b;
  })
);

//Output : [1, 2, 2, 7, 8, 34, 65]

Why is this happened so?
In JS the sorting method sorts on the basis of uni code control character. Means here 34 will be first converted to string '34' and then its first character will be grabbed that is '3' and then it will be placed in the list according to its Uni code control characters.

if we console the unicode of 3 and 6 as its grabbing only first letter we will have
console.log('34'.charCodeAt(0)) // 51
console.log('65'.charCodeAt(0)) // 54

Therefore, it is happening this way.

Example 2: Accent alphabets
const a = 'rÃ©servÃ©'; // With accents, lowercase
const b = 'RESERVE'; // No accents, uppercase

console.log(a.localeCompare(b));
// Expected output: 1
console.log(a.localeCompare(b, 'en', { sensitivity: 'base' }));
// Expected output: 0

*******************
https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms
This is a site of animation of sorting algorithms. We all just need to remember out their trade off. We will not implement the algorithms for scratch in our daily life. We just have to learn when and where to use which one.
Following are the sorting algorithms that we are gonna learn:
Bubble sort
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Merge sort
Quick sort


// ***************Bubble sort Algorithm
In this algorithm we start from the beginning of the array and start comparing first two numbers. The one which is larger will be shifted to the right and then it will compare with the number which is next to it until the largest number comes at the end of the array. In simple bubble sort algo simply bubbles out the largest value to the end of the array. Ultimately we ends up with a sorted array. 

// Implementation:
const letters = [2, 65, 34, 2, 1, 7, 8];

function bubbleSort(array) {
  const length = array.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < length - 1; j++) {
      if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
        swap(array, j, j + 1);
      }
    }
  }
}

const swap = (array, indexA, indexB) => {
  let temp = array[indexA];
  array[indexA] = array[indexB];
  array[indexB] = temp;
};

bubbleSort(letters);
console.log(letters);

NOTE: Here time complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(1)

****************Select Sorting algorithm
In this algorithm we assume the first value of the array as minimum value then we campare it with the rest of the array, if the first value which we assumed as minimum is not minimum then we update the value at first index with the one which is actually minimum then assumed value. And so on.
The reason why we call is select sort is that we select a value from the array and then compare it with rest of the elements and then we replace it.

Big O of select algorithm is:
Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)

//Implementation

const numbers = [99, 44, 6, 2, 1, 5, 63, 87, 283, 4, 0];

function selectionSort(array) {
    const length = array.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < length - 1; i++) {
        // Set current index as minimum
        let min = i;
        let temp = array[i];

        for (let j = i + 1; j < length; j++) {
            if (array[j] < array[min]) {
                // Update minimum if current is lower that what we had previously
                min = j;
            }
        }

        array[i] = array[min];
        array[min] = temp;
    }

    return array;
}

console.log(selectionSort(numbers));

********************Insertion Sort Alogirthm.

In this alogrithm we create an array as we move forward in the given array. And compare the coming value with the array we have created and insert the coming value in right place in our created array. Here right place means placing in order.

It is best of the cases where the given list is almost sorted where it gives O(n) linear time.
But in case of list which is very large and not sorted then it will give O(n^2). It is efficient for the lists which are almosted sorted.

//Implementation:
const numbers = [99, 44, 6, 2, 1, 5, 63, 87, 283, 4, 0];

function insertionSort(array) {
    const length = array.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        if (array[i] < array[0]) {
            // Move number to the first position
            array.unshift(array.splice(i, 1)[0]);
        } else {
            // Find where number should go
            for (let j = 1; j < i; j++) {
                if (array[i] > array[j - 1] && array[i] < array[j]) {
                    // Move number to the right spot
                    array.splice(j, 0, array.splice(i, 1)[0]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return array;
}

console.log(insertionSort(numbers));

******************Merge Sort
It is a divide and conquer algorithm which uses recursion concept. This is most efficient algorithm out of above all mentioned sorting algorithms. The time complexity of Merge sort is O(nlog n) which is better than O(n^2)

Here the concept is that the it splits the array in to 2 pieces and the futher divided those pieces until we reach till the single element. And then those single elements would be compared with each other and then merge. Its like merging the opened tree. Like first we expand a tree and then sort it and then merge it.

//Implementation
const numbers = [99, 44, 6, 2, 1, 5, 63, 87, 283, 4, 0];

function mergeSort(array) {
    if (array.length === 1) {
        return array;
    }

    // Split Array in into right and left
    const length = array.length;
    const middle = Math.floor(length / 2);
    const left = array.slice(0, middle);
    const right = array.slice(middle);

    return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
}

function merge(left, right) {
    const result = [];
    let leftIndex = 0;
    let rightIndex = 0;

    while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
        if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {
            result.push(left[leftIndex]);
            leftIndex++;
        } else {
            result.push(right[rightIndex]);
            rightIndex++;
        }
    }

    return result.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(right.slice(rightIndex));
}

const answer = mergeSort(numbers);
console.log(answer);

************Quick sort algo
In this algorithm we pick a pivot point and say all values greater then pivot point come its right and all value less than pivot point come to its left. Once it done we have two arrays one which is left to the pivot and other which is right to the pivot. Now we will again assume a pivot one from left and then sort the left accordingly and one from right and then sort it accordingly. And finally we will end up a sorted array

//Implementation
const numbers = [99, 44, 6, 2, 1, 5, 63, 87, 283, 4, 0];

function quickSort(array, left, right) {
  const len = array.length;
  let pivot;
  let partitionIndex;

  if (left < right) {
    pivot = right;
    partitionIndex = partition(array, pivot, left, right);

    //sort left and right
    quickSort(array, left, partitionIndex - 1);
    quickSort(array, partitionIndex + 1, right);
  }
  return array;
}

function partition(array, pivot, left, right) {
  let pivotValue = array[pivot];
  let partitionIndex = left;

  for (let i = left; i < right; i++) {
    if (array[i] < pivotValue) {
      swap(array, i, partitionIndex);
      partitionIndex++;
    }
  }
  swap(array, right, partitionIndex);
  return partitionIndex;
}

function swap(array, firstIndex, secondIndex) {
  var temp = array[firstIndex];
  array[firstIndex] = array[secondIndex];
  array[secondIndex] = temp;
}

//Select first and last index as 2nd and 3rd parameters
quickSort(numbers, 0, numbers.length - 1);
console.log(numbers);


*************When to use which sorting algorithm?
Bubble and selection: Not so efficient. No gonna use in practicle life they are just for teaching purposes.
Insertion: Use when input is smaller or array is almost sorted.
Merge sort: It is the best. Even in worst case it gives Big O of nlogn.
Quick sort: It is same as merge sort as it also gives Big O of nlogn. But if you dont select the right pivot value it can be worst as O (n^2) but in terms of space complexity it is better than Merge sort. So we can say in case of right pivot point Quick sort is best amongst all as it is best in terms of space and best in terms of speed.

***********Can we beat O(nlogn)?
In case of comparison sorting algorithms it is mathematically impossible. But in case of non-comparison sorting algortihms we can.
such as:
Radix and counting. These are the algorithms which are non comparison means they do sorting without comparison. But how?
They use binary codes to compare as the integers stores in the  memory. They used that knowledge. They are very very complex algorithms and can be only implemented to integers at very short range.

NOTE: Sort method in JS use which sorting algorithm? Since we have ECMA script in JS which is a standard and standard do not mention in which algo method should be implemented so It depends on the browsers engine. For example in mozilla the sorting method use Merge sort. In chrome's V8 engine lists are sorted using quick sort and insert sort for smaller arrays. 



***********************Searching Algorithm
There are many searching algorithms few of them are given below:
Linear Search
Binary Search
Depth First Search (DFS)
Breadth First Search (BFS)

***********Linear Search
In linear search we have to loop over all the elements step by step. Its bigO is O(n)
In the best it can be O(1)  when the item we are looking for is the first item in an array.

There are so many built-in methods which use linear search such as:

array.indexOf('any_iteam') //returns index

array.findIndex(function(item)=>{item === 'any_item'}); //return index

array.find(function(item)=>{item === 'any_item'}); //return item

array.includes('any_item'); //true or false

************Binary Search
do we have any benefit if the array is sorted?
If we know the list is sorted then we can use Binary search. Binary search uses divide and conquer approach in which we start finding a number from the middle of the array.

e.g arr = [1,3,4,6,9,12,34,65,94]

here let say we want to find 65.

so we will first go to the middle which is 9 here and we will check is 65>9 if yes, then ignore all elements left to the 9 and now we have left with [9,12,34,65,94]
here we will again divide it from the middle and will follow the same procedure. Is 65>34 if yes then ignore all elements left to 34 now we will left with. [34,65,94]

here middle point that is 65 is our answer.
Big O of binary search is O(logN)

Have you noticed a thing that is it like a tree?
Yes it is, storing data in tree data strcuture on which we are supposed to do search in future is more efficient as we can apply binary search on them. and we can reduce the time complexity.


******************BFS (Breadth First Search) + DFS (Deabth First search)
What if in trees and graphs we are supposed to visit each node? In such cases we know our BigO will be O(n). Visiting each node is called traversal. For such purposes we have BFS and DFS.
They are also called traversal algorithms.


***********BFS:
In breadth first search we go from left to right on each level of the tree. 

if we have tree like
	    1 
	   / \
	  4   3	
	 / \
	6   9

Then it will go like [1,4,3,6,9] And then it will find the node we are looking for.
BFS takes a memory as we have to keep track on every single node as we are going through it.
***PROS AND CONS of BFS:
Pros:
used for finding the shortest path.
And it goes to the closer node first.

Cons:
More memory requires as we have to keep track over all pointers of the node which we are visiting.

NOTE: If you know that your finding item is at top level of the tree or graph then we can use BFS.

************DFS (Deapth First search)
In Deapth first search are we go all the way in a leaf of a tree and then come back up. First we visit the all left nodes and then once left half portion has completed then we go for right half of the tree. It carries less memory as we do not have to remember all the pointers like BFS

***PROS AND CONS of DFS
Pros:
Is good for answering th question that does the path exist between 2 nodes? 
Less memory

Cons:
Can get slow in case the graph or tree is very very deep. Therefore they are not good at finding the shortest path.


NOTE: If you know that your finding item is at low level of the tree or graph then we can use DFS.

//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
BFS - DFS will be slower

//If the tree is very wide:
DFS - BFS will need too much memory, in a queue

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
BFS

****************In-order ,Pre-order, post-order

We can implemented Depth first search we have three ways to implement it.
We can either do In-order, Pre-order or post-order

//     9
//  4     20
//1  6  15  170
For the above tree following would be different orders:

In-order - [1, 4, 6, 9, 15, 20, 170] //simple ascending order
Pre-order - [9, 4, 1, 6, 20, 15, 170] //parent to child node
Post-order - [1, 6, 4, 15, 170, 20, 9] //child to parent node

************What is the time and space complexity of a breadth first and depth first tree traversal?

BFS:

Time complexity is O(|V|), where |V| is the number of nodes. You need to traverse all nodes.
Space complexity is O(|V|) as well - since at worst case you need to hold all vertices in the queue.

DFS:

Time complexity is again O(|V|), you need to traverse all nodes.
Space complexity - depends on the implementation, a recursive implementation can have a O(h) space complexity [worst case], where h is the maximal depth of your tree.
Using an iterative solution with a stack is actually the same as BFS, just using a stack instead of a queue - so you get both O(|V|) time and space complexity.

(*) Note that the space complexity and time complexity is a bit different for a tree than for a general graphs becase you do not need to maintain a visited set for a tree, and |E| = O(|V|), so the |E| factor is actually redundant.

*****************BFS and DFS for graphs
Since we know trees are the type of graphs so this means we can also apply BFS and DFS on graphs as well. Graphs and trees are best for the data having relations between them. 
BFS is best for finding the shortes path as BFS in graphs looks for the closest node first and then move forward. This is very helpful in applications such as facebook to check the closest friend and recommended lists in case of amazon. But BFS takes more memory

whereas DFS is best for checking whether the item exists or not. It is same as solving a maze. Where you go as deep as you can until you find a block from where you can go further. And then you track back yourself and find some other ways. It takes less memory but It can get very slow if you go very very deep into the graph of tree

***************Dijkstra and Bellman ford algorithms
These are two types of algorithm made for find the shortest path on graphs. But dont we have BFS for shortest path? Yes we have but BFS do not count the weight on edges of the graphs. We have studied in the graphs section that a graph data structure can have weights on their edges. Its same like some roads have more traffic than the other. So for taking the edges into account we use Dijskter and Bellman-ford alogorithm.

*********Dijsktra VS Bellman-Ford
Dijsktra is little bit faster than Bellman-Ford.
Bellman-ford algorithm can solve the graphs having negative weights. Whereas Dijsktra cannot solve graphs having negative weights.

So use Dijsktra when we have weighted graphs
use bellman-ford algorithm when we have weighted graphs with negative values.

*******************Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a technique to optimize the program. In Dynamic programming we solve a problem by breaking it down into the sub problems and then sloving each subproblem storing their solutions so that in case any of the solution might be used in future.

************Memoization
Memoization is a caching technique in which we save operations which are going to be call several times. In some cases if the parameters of a function are same and function has to perform the same long calculations over and over again. then instead of doing all the long calculations again we can do something like that:
//learn to cache
function addTo80(n) {
  console.log('long calcultion');
  return n + 80;
}

addTo80(5)

// here above on every time we call the function 'long calculation' will be printed. Means we can cached the result if parameters of the function are not changing.

let cache = {};
function memoizeAddTo80(n) {
  if (n in cache) {
    return cache[n];
  } else {
    console.log('long time');
    const answer = n + 80;
    cache[n] = answer;
    return answer;
  }
}

// console.log(1, memoizeAddTo80(6))
// // console.log(cache)
// // console.log('-----------')
// console.log(2, memoizeAddTo80(6))

**NOTE**: Here we a problem is that our cached object is a global object which should not be. It should be inside the function. But simply placing object inside the function will cause resetting the cache object everytime. This way long calculation will be printed again and again on every call.

The right way to make the cache object a local object is by using closures.

// let's make that better with no global scope. This is closure in javascript so.
function memoizeAddTo80(n) { 
  let cache = {};
  return function(n) {
    if (n in cache) {
      return cache[n];
    } else {
      console.log('long time');
      const answer = n + 80;
      cache[n] = answer;
      return answer;
    }
  }
}

const memoized = memoizeAddTo80();
console.log(1, memoized(6))
// console.log(cache)
// console.log('-----------')
console.log(2, memoized(6))

************Dynamic programming best example of Fibonacci sequence
As we know we can create fibonacci sequence using recursion and iterative approach.
Recursive approach have very poor time complexity of O(2^n) but we can significantly reduce it till O(n) using memoization technique.

//Traditional Fibonacci sequence using recursion:
//********************Fibonacci using recursion

let calculations = 0;
function FibonacchiRecursive(n) {
  calculations++;
  if (n < 2) {
    return n;
  }
  return FibonacchiRecursive(n - 2) + FibonacchiRecursive(n - 1);
}

console.log(FibonacchiRecursive(15));
console.log(`we did ${calculations} calculations`);

//Output: 
610
we did 1973 calculations

**NOTE:** here we had to perform 1973 calculations just to get the 15th index of fibonacci sequence.

************Fibonnacci using memoization //O(n)
let calculations2 = 0;
function FibonacchiMaster() {
  let cache = {};
  return function FibonacchiRecursiveMemoization(n) {
    calculations2++;
    if (n in cache) {
      return cache[n];
    } else if (n < 2) {
      return n;
    } else {
      cache[n] =
        FibonacchiRecursiveMemoization(n - 2) +
        FibonacchiRecursiveMemoization(n - 1);
      return cache[n];
    }
  };
}

const FibonacchiRecursiveMemoization = FibonacchiMaster();
console.log(FibonacchiRecursiveMemoization(15))
console.log(`we did ${calculations2} calculations using Memoization`);

// output :

610
we did 29 calculations using Memoization

**NOTE:** here you can see we just had to perform 29 calculations to get 15th index of Fibonacci series. Whereas without using memoization we had to perform 1973 huge amount of calculations. Now you will have an idea of powers of memoization
